# Lenovo ThinkCentre M910q additional 2.5GbE NIC

I was trying to find a solution to replace the m.2 2230 half wifi card that is one either board with a physical NIC. The problem is that the keying for the M.2 2230 slot or wifi card slot as they call it in thier documentation is keyed using either an A+E key or I believe just a straight E keyed M.2 would work fine. I finally found a vender that makes such a solution:
